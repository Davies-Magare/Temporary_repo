This is a cat. A cat drinks milk. Don't cats drink milk
I wish I had a cat but we know how many cats there are  these
days and I love Dickens so, meooow. Meoooow, meooow; and that
is how a cat sounds; and if a cat does not sound like that, then
we have a problem. Guess what cats are better than dogs: cats have more 
enviable characteristics as compared to dogs. You can't deny this. Cats
are more quiet and affectionate; dogs, on the other hand, are more chaotic
and love activity. Dogs have an important characteristic that cats lack: loyalty.
My dog is very loyal to me, and he follows me everywhere.
